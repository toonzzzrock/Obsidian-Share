# Ideation

This is come after [[needfinding]]

## 1. Point of View (Problem statement)

- A concise, actionable description of the problem based on user needs and insights
	- User: The people you observed
	- Facts: Things that you noticed by observation
	- Need: Your inference from fact, needs
	- Insights: “It will be nice if we can …”

## 2. How Might We
- Reframes problems into an actionable question
- Ex:
	- HMW make users no need to wait in front of the shop?
	- HMW make users feel safe when they are alone?
## 3. Brainstorming
- HMW are still problems but directly pointing out the solution.
- Brainstorming is about generating ideas for solutions.

# Design Goals
- This step done after ideation.
- This will make us see interactions between the desired/required ==tasks== that users already have and the design we offer.
- Without this:
  - We might end up with a design that doesn’t solve the problem.
  - We might end up with a design that is not usable.

Questions:
- Usage steps
- artifacts used
- goals of the task
- who are using the system
- how to measure success
- pain points that people experience already
