# Interview

- Tool to capture users’ needs
- Be curious about their “why”

## Interview flow
![](https://i.imgur.com/FmArCDJ.png)

- Introduce yourself, explain purpose and build enough rapport
- Evoke Stories: Ask open-ended questions, encourage the stories
- Explore more: Ask follow-up questions to dig deeper
## Good Questions
- Ask examples
- Ask about the past (fixed-time frame)


## Bad Questions

- Instead of using “why”:
	- “What led you to…”
	- “Can you tell me more about…”
- Avoid leading questions
- Avoid jargon (technical terms)
- Avoid “what if”
- Avoid “yes/no” questions
- Don’t ask multiple questions at once
- Don't ask rating in scale:
	- Because it doesn’t provide insights
	- Users often don’t know what they want
	- Users often bias their answers, inflate rating to be nice.

## Users

### Snowball sampling

- Snowball sampling is a non-probability sampling technique where existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances.
- It is used when a population is difficult to access.
- Compensation is needed.

### Lead Users

- Lead users are users who are ahead of the curve in terms of trends and needs. 
- Highly advanced users and inventors in their expertise.
- They often have unique needs and can provide valuable insights.
### Extreme Users

- Extreme users are users who are at the extremes of the user spectrum.
- But they are not representative of the majority of users.

### Persona

- A persona is a fictional character created to represent a user type that might use a site, brand, or product in a similar way.
- It helps to understand the user's needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals.
- Demographics, behavior patterns, motivations, and goals are included.
