# prototyping

- Approximate (quick) version of the design so that you can quickly get feedback.
- Design Hypothesis
- Feedback iteration
	1. Build prototypes
	2. Evaluation
	3. Learn for the next design
- Explore multiple prototypes rather than arguing with one specific version
- From ==low fidelity → High fidelity==
- Some goals often conflict with each other.
	- Prioritize them using feedback (from users)

- Interactivity
	1. Fixed prototype:Watch only
	2. Partially interactive: Fixed scenario prototype
	3. Fully interactive: Open prototype
## Fidelity
1. Low: Rough design, Feedback is broader
2. High: Close to final design, feedbacks more detailed

Prototyping technique order by fidelity
1. Lowest: Storyboards
2. Paper Prototype
3. Wireframing
4. Highest: Digital mock-ups

### Storyboard
- is this the right idea?
- Does it solve a problem?
- Does it meet a user’s need?

### Paper Prototype
- Rough idea of UI
- Reusable widgets

- High-level question
	- Does our design address the problem you want to solve?
- not low-level question
	- Is a button size slightly bigger?
### Wireframing
- more concrete digital UI

### Digital mock-ups
- high-level feedback
## Wizard of Oz prototyping
- users interact with a system that is fully functional but actually a human is performing the system’s functions.
## Video prototyping
- can be any fidelity
- effective in showing the context of usage
